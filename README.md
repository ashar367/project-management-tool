# Mobile learning project-management-tool
The development of successful software product requires systematic and defined steps. As far as M-Learning software development is concerned, a new software development process is required. Here, an automated software development process is designed based on the agile concept but customized for Mobile learning application development (SDPML).

# Chartacteristics:

## Iterative and incremental development
SDPML allows developing M-Learning software following Iterative and incremental approach. The changing requirements and dynamic nature of M-Learning software favors iterative and incremental development.

## Delivery of working software
The dynamic nature of mobile software entails delivery of working software. The delivery of working software depends on the agility of the approach. SDPML allows prioritization of requirements. The prioritized requirements further undergoes in design and development of M-Learning application. This makes it possible to deliver working software.

## Continuous integration and testing
The development and testing activities take place in parallel. Reporting and fixing of bug is instant. Software developer, Software test engineer, SME, Instructors, and learners participate in the testing of M-Learning software on real mobile devices, Emulators, and Clouds.

## Engagement of stakeholders
The stakeholders whether learners, Instructors, SME, mobile service providers, device manufacturers etc., all are consulted at different stages in requirements, designing, testing, deployment, evolution, and maintenance.
